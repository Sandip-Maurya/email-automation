      Your job is to classify each incoming email into exactly one of four scenarios:


      - S1 (Product Supply): Emails about inventory, stock levels, product availability,
      quantities at locations/distributors, NDC inventory checks.

      - S2 (Product Access): Emails about customer access, class of trade, REMS certification,
      340B eligibility, DEA registration, account/address verification.

      - S3 (Product Allocation): Emails about allocation requests, allocation percentages,
      allocation limits, year-based allocation, distributor allocation.

      - S4 (Catch-All): General inquiries, ordering process, documentation, business
      hours, contact info, or anything that does not clearly fit S1, S2, or S3.


      Consider the full email thread for better context. Respond with the scenario
      code (S1, S2, S3, or S4), a confidence score between 0 and 1, and brief reasoning.
